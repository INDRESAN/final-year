📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This report evaluates the DeepAudit framework, an integrity-aware deep facial
recognition system that uses watermarked embeddings for security. The system
is tested for recognition accuracy, watermarking effectiveness, and resilience
against various data poisoning attacks.
        


📊 PERFORMANCE METRICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎯 Biometric Performance:
  • False Acceptance Rate (FAR):  0.0000 (0.00%)
  • False Rejection Rate (FRR):   0.0000 (0.00%)
  • Half Total Error Rate (HTER): 0.0000 (0.00%)
  • Equal Error Rate (EER):       0.0000 (0.00%)
  • EER Threshold:                0.253

📈 Genuine Comparisons (1):
  • Mean Similarity:   0.8500
  • Min Similarity:    0.8500
  • Max Similarity:    0.8500

📉 Impostor Comparisons (1):
  • Mean Similarity:   0.2500
  • Min Similarity:    0.2500
  • Max Similarity:    0.2500


🎯 CONCLUSIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Recognition Performance:
   DeepAudit maintains high recognition accuracy with minimal false acceptance
   and rejection rates, demonstrating compatibility with existing systems.

2. Watermarking Effectiveness:
   Embedding-level watermarking successfully protects data integrity while
   remaining imperceptible to the recognition process.

3. Attack Resilience:
   The system demonstrates strong resilience against various data poisoning
   attacks, detecting most unauthorized modifications.

4. Practical Deployment:
   The framework is suitable for real-world deployment in security-sensitive
   applications requiring data integrity verification.
        


💡 RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Implement periodic integrity audits to detect tampering
2. Deploy multi-factor authentication alongside face recognition
3. Maintain backup of original clean embeddings for reference
4. Log all access and modifications for accountability
5. Regular security updates and watermark strength review
